# Weaning Age Reconstruction with Nitrogen Isotope
This repo stores R code for WARN. WARN package in R estimates precise weaning ages for a given skeletal population 	by analyzing the stable nitrogen isotope ratios of them. Bone collagen turnover rates estimated anew and the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) were adopted in this package.
